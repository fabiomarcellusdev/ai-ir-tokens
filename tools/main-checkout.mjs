// main-checkout.mjs: finds the main checkout of this repository, also from inside a linked git worktree.
//
// The owner's private files are git-ignored, so only the main checkout has them: private-docs/ (the privacy terms)
// and .local/ (the quiet hours). A new worktree does not. If a guard read them from its own checkout, it would skip
// its check there without a word. So the guards read them from the main checkout (decision 0004, amendment
// "parallel checkouts").
//
// A session in a worktree can rewrite or delete its own `.git` file, so that file alone must never decide where the
// main checkout is (security review, 2026-11-08). The main checkout comes from the folder layout that
// tools/worktree.mjs makes, and git's own records must agree with it:
//
// 1. `<root>/.git` is a folder without a `commondir` file, and <root> is not inside a `<name>.worktrees` folder:
//    <root> is the main checkout.
// 2. <root> is `<parent>/<name>.worktrees/<branch>`: the main checkout is `<parent>/<name>`. Its `.git` must be a
//    folder; `<root>/.git` must be a file whose gitdir is inside `<main>/.git/worktrees/`; and that folder's
//    `gitdir` file (git's back-link) must point to `<root>/.git`; and its `commondir` file (the repository that git
//    really uses) must point to `<main>/.git`. Paths are compared after links are resolved.
// 3. No `.git` and no `.worktrees` parent (a source copy, as in some CI steps): <root> is used as it is.
// 4. Anything else: it throws. The callers fail closed: a push is refused, and quiet hours count as on.
//
// It reads files only and starts no git process, because the quiet-hours hook calls it before every tool call.
