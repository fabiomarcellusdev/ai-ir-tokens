// quiet-hours-guard.mjs: a Claude Code PreToolUse hook for every tool (matcher "*"), in the main session and in
// subagents. Inside the owner's quiet hours (tools/quiet-hours.mjs, .local/quiet-hours.json), it asks the owner to
// approve each tool call. Outside them, or with no quiet hours set, it stays silent. Decision record: 0005.
//
// It fails closed: if the module cannot load or the check throws, it asks. The hook entry in .claude/settings.json
// also sets onFailure "block", so a crash, a timeout or a missing node blocks the call.
