description: Close a phase, or another milestone in docs/testing.md, only when every required check passes. Use before saying a phase is done, before merging a phase branch, and before a release.

# Gate check

1. Read the phase in `docs/roadmap.md`, its gate in `docs/contract.md`, and the milestone's checks in
   `docs/testing.md`.
2. Run `node tools/check.mjs gate` under the machine rules. Every check must pass. Do not skip a check, and do not
   re-run a failing check until it passes: a flaky check is a bug.
3. Run the gate's own measurement with the `measurement-run` skill. Compare the result with the gate's number, fixed
   before the run.
4. Ask the `adversarial-reviewer` agent to review the phase's changes, and the `security-reviewer` agent for phases
   3, 4 and 9 and any change to file access, config loading, hooks or dependencies.
5. Report: each check with PASS or FAIL, the gate's number against its threshold, the reviewers' findings, and the
   open rows in `docs/follow-ups.md` that the phase leaves behind.
6. A missed gate is recorded as missed in `docs/contract.md` and `docs/current-work.md`. The owner decides what
   happens next.
